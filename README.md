# Steps Recorder

A basic step tracking application developed using MIT App Inventor. This app utilizes the device's pedometer sensor to count steps and provides a simple interface to manage the tracking.

## Overview

The Steps Recorder app allows users to monitor their physical activity by counting the steps taken. It offers control over the tracking process with start, stop, and reset functions.

## Features

* **Step Counting:** Tracks steps using the device's built-in pedometer sensor.
* **Start/Stop Tracking:** Control when step counting is active.
* **Reset Counter:** Clear the current step count.
* **Display Steps:** Shows the accumulated steps on the screen.
* **Voice Feedback:** Provides an audio message when step tracking begins.

## Requirements

To build and run this application, you will need:

* An account on the MIT App Inventor website (appinventor.mit.edu).
* A computer with internet access.
* An Android device with a built-in pedometer sensor or an emulator that supports sensor simulation, for testing the application.

## Building the Application

Refer to the `step-to-step_guide.md` file for detailed instructions on how to recreate this application within the MIT App Inventor environment.

## How to Use

1.  Launch the application on your Android device.
2.  Tap the **Start** button to begin counting steps. You will hear a voice message.
3.  Keep the device with you as you walk; steps will be automatically recorded.
4.  The current step count will be displayed on the screen.
5.  Tap the **Stop** button to pause step counting.
6.  Tap the **Reset** button to clear the step count and reset it to zero.
